<HTML><BODY>After two folklore books on Tirol and one on the Far East, here is another folklore book by Rachel Harriette Busk, this time a collection of Spanish stories published in 1870.

<p>The work should not pose many difficulties. Mind the occasional accents and the tilde on the letter n (ñ) in Spanish words, and some footnotes here and there.

<p>Have fun!.</BODY></HTML>
